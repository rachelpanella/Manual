		<figure class="quote2" id="titleformat">
        <blockquote>
		<h4>Title Format</h4>
		<p><b>(  ),  [  ],  "  "</b>		When these punctuation marks enclose the whole title, omit them. If the artist used these marks to punctuate a title within a title or an explanatory phrase within a title, then record as inscribed, verbatim.</p>
		<p><b>.	</b>		Some inscriptions end with a period or have two-part titles, each with a period. Record these as inscribed.</p>
		<p><b>&</b> 			Record if printed or inscribed. Do not substitute "and" without specific and contrary directive from Curatorial or the living artist.</p>
		<p><b>Capitalization</b>		If the inscription includes nonstandard capitalization (i.e. all lowercase or all uppercase, capital letters in the middle of words) or does not capitalize names or proper nouns, correct the capitalization to reflect the title style described above, unless specific and contrary directive is made by the living artist or Curatorial.</p>
		<p>
		<ul>
		<li>Do capitalize:</li>
		  <ul>
          <li>All nouns and pronouns, e.g. “It, Its, His, That, This, My” </li>
          <li>All verbs, except "to" when part of the infinitive verb form, e.g. "to Go," is in lower case.</li>
          <li>All adjectives and adverbs, e.g. “Very, Well, Badly”</li>
          <li>All prepositions of 5 letters or more, e.g. “After, Beneath, Through”</li>
          <li>All subordinate conjunctions, e.g. “That, Which, Who”</li>
          <li>The first and last words of the title regardless of part of speech</li>
          </ul>
        </ul>
		<ul>
		<li>Do <i>not</i> capitalize: </li>
		  <ul>
          <li>Prepositions of 4 or fewer letters, e.g. “from, in, at” </li>
          <li>Coordinate conjunctions, e.g. “and, but, or” </li>
          <li>Articles, e.g. “a, an, the” </li>
          </ul>
        </ul>
		<p><b>Scientific nomenclature</b>	In both titles and running text, technical scientific names are to be capitalized according to scientific and Latin convention: the genus name is always capitalized, and the specific epithet is never capitalized (even though it may be a proper adjective), without any intervening punctuation.1 If the printed text from which the title is transcribed is printed in all caps, record the title in all caps in Inscriptions but then record the title in correct Latin capitalization in the appropriate title field. Scientific binomial nomenclature is customarily set in italics; ACM Publications will oversee the typesetting details for labels or publications.</p>
		<p><b>Dates in titles</b>		If a date has been included in the artist’s own inscription of the title or in the artist’s documented original title, then that date is likewise included in the Title and formatted accordingly. This guideline also applies to works such as inscribed field studies or documented pages from a field sketchbook. Judgment of sufficient documentation is left to the discretion of the curator.</p>
		<figure class="quote">
		<blockquote>
		<ul>
		<li>Valley of the Chugwater, Wyoming Territory, August 8, 1870</li>
		<li>La Parroquia, Santa Fe, New Mexico, 1849</li>
		<li>Chinese Irrigation Nevada, August 9</li>
		</ul>

		</blockquote>
		</figure>
		<p><b>Long titles</b>		Some historical prints have very long inscriptions. The project curator will make the judgment as to what should be the Title and what should be recorded only as an inscription. Very long titles may also be terminated with ellipses.</p>
		<p><b>Misspelled words</b>	Words spelled incorrectly in the inscription from which the title is transcribed are generally recorded as-is, and “[sic]” is inserted after the misspelled word, particularly if it is a nineteenth-century work. “Sic” is a complete word, not an abbreviation, and takes no period. It is customarily set in italics; ACM Publications will oversee the typesetting details for labels or publications.</p>

	  <h4>Two Dimensional Objects</h4>
	  <p>Use the following format:<br><br>Inscription surface, recto/verso:<br><br>Grid position  (supplementary surface,)  (additional description of position,)  inscription medium:  inscription text line 1  \  inscription text line 2  [additional explanation or interpretation]<br>
		Identify and record each major planar surface that bears an inscription (e.g. image, sheet, [photo] print or mount) as a capitalized heading on the accession worksheet or in the superfield, and specify “recto” or “verso”, followed by a colon. <br>
		If there are not any inscriptions, record “[None]” in the field. This will indicate that inscriptions have been verified. There is not a need to record none for every planar surface. <br><br>
		Record the general position of the inscription, using the following grid and abbreviations:</p>
		<table>
		<tr class="borders">
		<td class="borders">u.l.</td>
		<td class="borders">u.c.</td>
		<td class="borders">u.r.</td>

		<td class="borders">l.l.</td>
		<td class="borders">l.c.</td>
		<td class="borders">l.r.</td>
		</tr>
		</table>
		<p>If the inscription is not written on the actual surface of the object or mount but on a supplementary surface, record a succinct description of the supplementary surface, e.g. “on white label” or “on green masking tape,” followed by a comma.</p>
		<p>Inscriptions recorded during process, such as “on stone,” “in plate,” or “in negative,” are considered legitimate and are to be recorded with that implied surface specified. Make precise use of the descriptor “in image”— use only when the inscription is arguably within the image and not merely within the physical boundaries of the stone, plate, or negative.</p>
		<p>Record any additional description of position, as necessary, e.g. “along top edge of sheet” or “beneath plate mark,” followed by a comma.</p>
		<p>Record the medium of the inscription itself, i.e. the material or technical means with which the inscription was made, followed by a colon.  For example: “in ink:”; “in graphite:”; “typewritten”; “in white paint”. If no supplementary surface or additional description of position is included, do not place a comma between the grid location and the medium of the inscription.</p>
		<p>Use the term “in graphite” rather than “in pencil”. However, if a colored pencil is used, specify the color (as it is not composed of graphite). Color of ink may be specified at the discretion of the cataloguer.</p>
		<p>Following the colon, record all inscriptions verbatim (letter for letter), including any and all capitalization, punctuation, and diacritical marks.  Do not use quotation marks unless they actually appear in the text of the inscription.</p>
		<p>Distinguish inscriptions from text that is part of the work of art. Do not record as inscriptions non-annotating words or text characters inscribed upon the work. This guideline is directed toward inscriptions made in the object’s catalogued medium/media. Designation of what is and what is not an inscription is left to the cataloguer. Ex.: Signature and date in oil paint on an oil-on-canvas painting is an inscription. The word “Blips” in oil paint on an oil-on-canvas painting is not an inscription, e.g. 1967.195</p>
		<p>Record the text of the inscription from left to right and then from top to bottom. An inscription that extends more than one line on the object should be recorded with a single backslash in place of each line break; two spaces should both precede and follow the backslash.</p>
		<p>If an object surface bears multiple inscriptions, record them in order from left to right and then from top to bottom, using the same guidelines listed above for each inscription.</p>
		<p>Enclose any subsequent explanatory/interpretive descriptors in brackets, e.g. [illeg.], [circled], [sic].  If the descriptor only applies to a specific portion of the preceding text, repeat that text as necessary.</p>
		<p>When positive identification can be made or has been made, annotate all inscriptions made in the artist’s own hand, e.g. [artist’s hand]</p>
		<p>Use the descriptor “lettered” and not “printed” to refer to mechanically or electronically printed lettering. </p>

		<h4>Two sided objects</h4>
		<p>When recording inscriptions on objects that are two-sided and catalogued as two alphabetic subparts, do not record the same inscription twice. Instead, record a reference to see the record for the opposite side of the object; “[see A/B-side]” should suffice.<br> 
		Photographs mounted in an album are not subject to this guideline. Although the album pages may be numbered consecutively, the photographs are classified as separate objects (numeric subparts) mounted to a common surface. Record inscriptions on photographs in albums in the conventional manner.<br>

	  <li>Private Owners</li>
	  <p>“Private Owner” refers to known individuals, families or museums.  Do not use brackets around the entry.

If a set of proofs consists of more than one print, numbers are usually inscribed to indicate the number of prints within the total number of the particular type of proof, (e.g. AP 5/20 designates the fifth print in a set of 20 identical prints authorized as artist’s proofs). </p>
